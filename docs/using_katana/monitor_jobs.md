title: Monitor your Jobs(qstat, qdel, qalter)
## Get information about the state of the scheduler

When deciding which jobs to run, the scheduler takes the following details into account:

- are there available resources
- how recently has this user run jobs successfully
- how many resources has this user used recently
- how long is the job's Walltime
- how long has the job been in the queue

You can get an overview of the compute nodes and a list of all the jobs running on each node using `pstat`

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
``` bash
[z1234567@katana2 src]$ pstat
k001  normal-mrcbio           free          12/44   200/1007gb  314911*12
k002  normal-mrcbio           free          40/44    56/ 377gb  314954*40
k003  normal-mrcbio           free          40/44   375/ 377gb  314081*40
k004  normal-mrcbio           free          40/44    62/ 377gb  314471*40
k005  normal-ccrc             free           0/32     0/ 187gb
k006  normal-physics          job-busy      32/32   180/ 187gb  282533*32
k007  normal-physics          job-busy      32/32   180/ 187gb  284666*32
k008  normal-physics          free           0/32     0/ 187gb
k009  normal-physics          job-busy      32/32   124/ 187gb  314652*32
k010  normal-physics          free           0/32     0/ 187gb      
```

To get information about a particular node, you can use `pbsnodes` but on its own it is a firehose. Using it with a particular node name is more effective:
=======
In short, the scheduler tries to balance efficiency (keeping the system busy) with fairness (making sure everyone gets a fair share of
resources).

Understanding these factors can help you make better choices about resource requests and job planning.

## Managing Your Own Jobs

Once your jobs are in the queue or running, youâ€™ll want to monitor and manage them. Common tasks include:

- **Checking job status**
- **Deleting jobs you no longer need**
- **Altering queued jobs (e.g. reducing walltime)**

On Katana, these taskes are manged using PBS commmands as follows:

<h3> Checking Job Status with `qstat` </h3>

`qstat` shows the jobs currently in the queue. Without options it prints **all jobs**, so you may want to filter.

<div style="flex: 1; margin-right: 20px;">
		<img src="../../assets/qstat.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: 150px;">
</div>

<h4> Show Only Your Jobs </h4>

Use the `-u` option with your username or `$USER` environment variable (Which is automatically set to your username/zID):

<div style="flex: 1; margin-right: 20px;">
		<img src="../../assets/qstat_USER.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: 50px;">
</div>
<div style="flex: 1; margin-right: 20px;">
		<img src="../../assets/qstat_job.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: 50px;">
</div>

In the output, you can see the job ID, name, user, time used, and status. The status codes are:

| State | Meaning                         |
| ----- | ------------------------------- |
| **Q** | Queued (waiting to start)       |
| **R** | Running                         |
| **C** | Completed (finished or stopped) |
| **H** | Held (paused by user or admin)  |
| **E** | Exiting (finishing up)          |
| **S** | Suspended (temporarily stopped) |
| **B** | Job arrays only: job array is begun, meaning that at least one subjob has started |
| **F** | Job is finished. Job has completed execution, job failed, or job was deleted. |
| **M** | Job is moved to another server. |


The `-s` option adds more detail such as which node the job is on:
```bash
[z1234567@katana2 src]$ qstat -su $USER
```

<h3> Get Full Details </h3>
```bash
[z1234567@katana2 src]$ qstat -f 6900507
```
<div style="flex: 1; margin-right: 20px;">
		<img src="../../assets/qstat_-f.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: 700px;">
</div>
This is useful for debugging and verifying resource requests.

## Managing Jobs on Katana

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Once you have jobs running, you will want visibility of the system so that you can manage them - delete jobs, change jobs, check that jobs are still running.

<h3> Deleting Jobs with `qdel` </h3>
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

There are a couple of easy to use commands that help with this process.

        `qstat` gives very long output. Consider piping to `less`

        <h3>List just my jobs</h3>

        You can use either your **ZID** or the [Environment Variable](../../help_support/glossary#environment-variable) `$USER`

        ``` bash
            [z2134567@katana2 src]$ qstat -u $USER
            kman.restech.unsw.edu.au: 
                                                                        Req'd  Req'd   Elap

        ```

        If you add the `-s` flag, you will get slightly more status information.

        ``` bash
        [z1234567@katana2 src]$ qstat -su z1234567

    === "qdel"
        Remove a job from the queue or kill it if it's started. To remove an array job, you must include the square braces and they will need to be escaped. In that situation you use `qdel 12345\[\]`. Uses the `$JOBID` 

        ``` bash
        [z1234567@katana2 src]$ qdel 315252
        ```


    === "qalter"
        Once a job has been submitted, it can be altered. However, once a job begins execution, the only values that can be modified are `cputime`, `walltime`, and `run_count`. These can only be reduced.

        Users can only lower resource requests on queued jobs. If you need to increase resources, contact a systems administrator. In this example you will see the resources change - but not the `Submit_arguments`

        ``` bash
        [z1234567@katana2 src]$ qsub -l select=1:ncpus=2:mem=128mb job.pbs
        315259.kman.restech.unsw.edu.au
        [z1234567@katana2 src]$ qstat -f 315259
        Job Id: 315259.kman.restech.unsw.edu.au
            ...
            Resource_List.mem = 128mb
            Resource_List.ncpus = 2
            ...
            Submit_arguments = -W group_list=GENERAL -N job.pbs -l select=1:ncpus=2:mem=128mb job.pbs.YOOu3lB
            project = _pbs_project_default
            
        [z1234567@katana2 src]$ qalter -l select=1:ncpus=4:mem=512mb 315259; qstat -f 315259
        Job Id: 315259.kman.restech.unsw.edu.au
            ...
            Resource_List.mem = 512mb
            Resource_List.ncpus = 4
            ...
            Submit_arguments = -W group_list=GENERAL -N job.pbs -l select=1:ncpus=2:mem=128mb job.pbs.YOOu3lB
            project = _pbs_project_default
        ```

## Job Stats

As soon as your job finishes, PBS produces job statistics along with a summary of your job. This summary appears as follows (replace ```4638435.kman.restech.unsw.edu.au.OU``` for your output file; the steps for retrieving the file name are outlined below):
```bash
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
z123456@katana2:~ $ cat 4638435.kman.restech.unsw.edu.au.OU
=======
[z1234567@katana2 src]$ qdel 315252
```

---

<h3> Altering Jobs with `qalter` </h3>

If there is a need to reduce resource requests (e.g. walltime, memory) for a job that is still in the queue (not yet running), you can use `qalter`. For example, to change the number of CPUs and memory:

Example:  
```bash
# Submit a job with 2 CPUs and 128GB memory
[z1234567@katana2 src]$ qsub -l select=1:ncpus=2:mem=64gb job.pbs
315259.kman.restech.unsw.edu.au

# Change it to 4 CPUs and 128GB memory while queued
[z1234567@katana2 src]$ qalter -l select=1:ncpus=4:mem=128gb 315259
```

---

## Viewing Job Statistics After Completion

When a job finishes, PBS appends a resource usage summary to your output file. The output file contains both your programâ€™s results (e.g. print statements) and PBS system information about how much memory and time your job actually used. For example:

```bash
[z1234567@katana2 src]$ cat 4638435.kman.restech.unsw.edu.au.OU
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

================================================================================
                     Resource Usage on 27/07/2023 15:43:37

Job Id: 4638435
Queue: CSE
Walltime: 00:00:03  (requested 01:00:00)
Job execution was successful. Exit Status 0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|              |             CPUs              |            Memory             |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Node         | Requested   Used   Efficiency | Requested   Used   Efficiency |
| k080         |     1        0.0      0.0%    |   1.0gb    0.01gb     1.0%    |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
This text is appended at the end of your output file. If you haven't specified an output file, one will be generated for you and placed in the folder where you submit your job.

If you're unsure about the location of your job statistics file, you can run the following command (replace 4682962 with your job ID):
```bash
z123456@katana2:~ $ qstat -xf 4682962
```
then search for Output_Path. For example, in below example, the absolute path of the output file is ```/home/z123456/output_file.txt```. Interactive jobs do no show a file name, for those cases the output file name look as ```4638435.kman.restech.unsw.edu.au.OU``` and is placed on the folder where you submitted the job:
```bash

## Checking Nodes and Jobs on the Cluster

<h3> View All Nodes with `pstat` </h3>

The `pstat` command gives an overview of all compute nodes and what jobs are running on them:

```bash
[z1234567@katana2 src]$ pstat
Node  Group                  State        CPUs   Memory
k001  normal-mrcbio           free          12/44   200/1007gb
k002  normal-mrcbio           free          40/44    56/ 377gb
k003  normal-mrcbio           free          40/44   375/ 377gb
k004  normal-mrcbio           free          40/44    62/ 377gb
k005  normal-ccrc             free           0/32     0/ 187gb
k006  normal-physics          job-busy      32/32   180/ 187gb
...
```

In each row you can see the **node ID**, queue name, whether itâ€™s free or busy, how many CPUs are in use, and memory usage.

<h3> Detailed Info About One Node with `pbsnodes` </h3>

The `pbsnodes` command shows detailed information about nodes. Without arguments it can be overwhelming. Use it with a node name to narrow results:

```bash
[z1234567@katana2 src]$ pbsnodes k254
k254
    Mom = k254
    ntype = PBS
    state = job-busy
    pcpus = 32
    jobs = 313284.kman.restech.unsw.edu.au/0, 313284.kman.restech.unsw.edu.au/1
    resources_available.arch = linux
    resources_available.cputype = skylake-avx512
    resources_available.mem = 196396032kb
    resources_assigned.ncpus = 32
    resources_assigned.mem = 50331648kb
    sharing = default_shared
    last_state_change_time = Thu Apr 30 08:06:23 2020
```
This lets you check CPU type, available memory, assigned jobs, and more.

**Summary:**  
Typical workflow:

- Submit job â†’ qsub myjob.pbs

- Check status â†’ qstat -u $USER

- If needed, adjust â†’ qalter â€¦ or cancel â†’ qdel JOBID

- After it finishes, check output file â†’ cat jobid.OU
