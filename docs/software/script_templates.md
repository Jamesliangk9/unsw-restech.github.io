title: Job Script Template

`UNSW has an organisation in GitHub` for researchers and staff, joining this organisation gives you access to the UNSW-only repositories like:
 
-  `Restech-HPC - Example job scripts for Katana and NCI`
-  `UNSW-Data-Archive - Scripts for uploading to and downloading from the UNSW Data Archive`
-  `UNSW-eNotebook-LabArchives - UNSW eNotebook (LabArchives) widgets`
 
There is even a UNSW specific LaTeX thesis template!

We encourage researchers to use the `Citation File Format` when writing code.
