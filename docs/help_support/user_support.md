!!! info
    This is the best way to get help from UNSW Research Technology Services. You *must* use your UNSW email address *or* your zID. Without this information, we don't
	know who you are and may be unable to solve your issue.

    When writing your email, please include a clear and detailed description of the request or issue experienced including any error messages and node name if appropriate. 
	Something like "It doesn't work" doesn't help us help you! If at all possible, include the steps someone else needs to do to reproduce the problem, the job identifier, the date and time of your problem and on which Katana node it occurred, the script filename and the directory you were running from.

    **Example of a bad request**
        I'm trying to do some work on katana, but it seems to be running slowly today.
        
    **Example of a great request**
        When I tried to run Sentaurus TCAD today (2020-05-01) on Katana I got this error message regardless of structures I wanted to simulate:
            
        Job failed
        Error: Child process with pid '116643' got the signal 'SIGSEGV' (segmentation violation)
        job exits with status 1
        
        My job ran on k052 with jobid 300000, my zID is z2134567
