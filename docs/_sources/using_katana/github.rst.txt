Version control systems like GitHub record changes to files over time, allowing you to go back to older versions, and create new branches for experimentation. 

Version control is most useful for keeping track of programming code and documentation - large text based corpora that aren't suitable for storing in databases.

`UNSW has an organisation in GitHub`_ for researchers and staff, joining this organisation gives you access to the UNSW-only repositories. There is even a UNSW specific LaTeX thesis template!
 
-  `Restech-HPC - Example job scripts for Katana and NCI`_
-  `UNSW-Data-Archive - Scripts for uploading to and downloading from the UNSW Data Archive`_
-  `UNSW-eNotebook-LabArchives - UNSW eNotebook (LabArchives) widgets`_

We encourage researchers to use the `Citation File Format`_ when writing code.
