Katana OnDemand
###############

There are a number of GUI based software packages that are offered through a web interface. The requirements are a Katana account and for the user to be either on campus or connected to the `UNSW VPN`_.

These can be accessed from https://kod.restech.unsw.edu.au

After logging in, you can:

- Access your :code:`/home/`, :code:`/srv/scratch/` and any project files from the Files menu. While you can upload files through this interface, please don't upload anything larger than about 10MB. 

- See your active jobs in a web based view of the traditional :code:`qstat` command

- Start a new interactive app


Installed interactive apps are availble in a drop-down list

The status of your interactive sessions can be seen using the rightmost 'My Interactive Sessions' icon.

Clicking on the Session ID display files that are useful for debubbing purposes. Please include their contents if submitting a support request.
